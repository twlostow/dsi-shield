DSI Core Readme
------------------------

0. Disclaimer

This project implements a MIPI DSI (MIPI Display Serial Interface) Verilog core.
Since the DSI specification is non-public and requires an NDA, the core was built
using bits and pieces available throughout the Web: presentations, display controller/SOC
datasheets, various application notes and Android kernel drivers. The author is not 
associated in any way with the MIPI Alliance. The core is provided as-is, it has never been
verified for compliance with the DSI standard and it probably lacks many of its features.
You use it at your own risk, there's no warranty.
